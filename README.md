- It's similar to Google Docs but for coding! (with syntax highlighting, online compilation etc.)
- Join a room with your friends and start coding!
- It also has a chat feature!
- Check it out, it's hosted here! : https://code-colab-tk.onrender.com/
- (! The website may take around 30s to load as it's hosted on a free server, which automatically goes to sleep due to inactivity)
